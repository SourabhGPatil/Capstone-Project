# User Interface Automation Testing Project

This project focuses on automating UI testing for the website [Automation Practice](http://automationpractice.com/index.php) using Selenium with Java, implementing the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. UI automation testing plays a critical role in ensuring the quality and reliability of web applications by automating the interaction with user interfaces. By utilizing Selenium, developers can simulate user actions across various browsers, ensuring compatibility and functionality across different platforms. The Page Object Model (POM) design pattern enhances test maintainability and readability by encapsulating web elements and their related functionalities into separate classes. This approach promotes reusability and reduces code duplication, leading to more efficient test development and maintenance.

## Project Instructions

1. **Automate the UI**: Automate the UI for the website - http://automationpractice.com/index.php.
2. **Write Test Scripts**: Write test scripts for two pages using the Page Object Model (POM).
3. **Test Scenarios**: Each page must have five test scenarios, approved by the mentor.
4. **TestNG Implementation**: Utilize TestNG for all test cases.
5. **Browser Independence**: Ensure automation tests are browser-independent.

## Technology Stack

- **Selenium**: Selenium is an open-source tool used to automate web browsers. It provides a rich set of APIs for interacting with web elements and executing browser actions programmatically.
- **Java**: Java programming language is utilized to write Selenium test scripts. Java's robustness and platform independence make it a popular choice for building automation frameworks.
- **Cucumber**: Cucumber is employed as a tool based on the Behavior Driven Development (BDD) framework, facilitating the writing of acceptance tests for the web application. It allows test scenarios to be written in a human-readable format, promoting collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- **TestNG**: TestNG is an open-source test automation framework for Java. It enhances automated tests by making them more structured, readable, maintainable, and user-friendly. TestNG provides features such as annotations, grouping, and parameterization, enabling developers to create comprehensive test suites.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: POM is a design pattern in Selenium that establishes an object repository for storing all web elements of a webpage. By encapsulating web elements and their related actions into separate classes, POM promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

## Feature Files in UI Automation Testing

Feature files in UI automation testing play a pivotal role in implementing Behavior Driven Development (BDD) practices. These files contain human-readable scenarios, outlining application behavior from an end-user perspective. By defining scenarios with Given-When-Then steps, feature files promote collaboration, clarity, and better test coverage. They serve as living documentation, facilitating continuous refinement of test scenarios as the application evolves. Overall, feature files bridge the communication gap between stakeholders and technical teams, fostering collaboration and driving quality in UI automation testing projects.
